##Building a Shopping Cart##

This was built following along with [this](https://richonrails.com/articles/building-a-shopping-cart-in-ruby-on-rails) tutorial. The application is a very basic store app with a shopping cart that keeps track of purchased items. 

Next steps might be to add an admin interface and look into users.
